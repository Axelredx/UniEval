# UniEval
NOTE: this file is not intended to offend anyone in any way, it MUST be treated only like a personal diary where i do a recap of the subject I've succeded at Computer Science an Technology course at UniBo. (work in progress!)

Legend: 
+         each subject is valuated with a rating 0 to 5 in:
                    1.Personal level of interest 2.Difficulty of the subject
                    3.Difficulty of the exams    4.Average evaluation
                    (Higher is the 1|4. value, higher is the interest|personal appreciation of the subject; 
                     Lower is the value in 2|3, higher the difficulty of subject itself|exam;).
+         If the rating is 'N/A' (Not Assigned) followed by 'optional' it means that i've succeded the subject without
          doing that part cause that part was optional (in this case the final grade will be arbitrarily lowered by
          the professor); If instead 'N/A' is followed by 'only if requested by professor' it means that that that
          part of exam was necessary only if requested by the professor (in this case the final grade won't be lowered).
