# UniEval
NOTE: this file is not intended to offend anyone it's just a personal recap of the subject of the cs course I've succeded at cs course of UniBo.

Legend: each subject is valuated with a rating up to 5 in:
+         1.Personal level of interest 2.Difficulty of the subject
          3.Difficulty of the exams 4.Average evaluation
          (Higher is the 4. value, higher is personal classified the subject; 
           Lower is the value in 2. and 3., higher the difficulty;
           Higher is the value in 1., higher is the interest).
