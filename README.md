# UniEval
NOTE: this file is not intended to offend anyone in any way, it's just a personal recap of the subject of the cs course I've succeded at cs course of UniBo. (work in progress!)

Legend: each subject is valuated with a rating 0 to 5 in:
+         1.Personal level of interest 2.Difficulty of the subject
          3.Difficulty of the exams 4.Average evaluation
          (Higher is the 1|4. value, higher is the interest|personal appreciation of the subject; 
           Lower is the value in 2|3, higher the difficulty of subject itself|exam;).
